[![License](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/cakephp/app.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/cakephp/app)

Made with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 3.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation

To install this codebase on a server, use git.
 
`git clone https://github.com/tjcrowley/VVI.git ./VVI`

Set your webserver's webroot to ./VVI/webroot

Restart the webserver. 

## Configuration

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the `'Datasources'` and any other
configuration relevant for your server. 

## Layout

The app skeleton uses a subset of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) (v5) CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
